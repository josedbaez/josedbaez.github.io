How to add dynamic geojson fields to Solr 6 to index and search geospatial data.
<!-- more -->

*Versions used: Solr 6.6.3.*

Solr supports indexing spatial fields on industry standards: [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) and [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/). In this post, I'll be going through indexing spatial fields on GeoJSON format, especially to index polygons.

First, you need to choose between [SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType (RPT)](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/spatial-search.html#SpatialSearch-RPT) or [RptWithGeometrySpatialField (RPT with Geometry)](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/spatial-search.html#SpatialSearch-RptWithGeometrySpatialField). Both support indexing polygons but there are a couple of technical differences that can suit your needs better. I chose RPT with Geometry.

For polygon support, you will need [JTS Topology Suite](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/). Navigate to this [URL](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vividsolutions/jts-core/), click on required version and download file __jts-core-VERSION#.jar__. This file should be copied to: __Solr Installation Folder\server\solr-webapp\webapp\WEB-INF\lib\__

Add the new field type to your Solr index schema. 
``` xml
<!-- RPT -->
<fieldType name="geojson_rpt" class="solr.SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType" spatialContextFactory="JTS" geo="true" format="GeoJSON" autoIndex="true" validationRule="repairBuffer0" distErrPct="0.025" maxDistErr="0.001" distanceUnits="kilometers" />
<!-- RPT with geometry -->
<fieldType name="geojson_rptgeom" class="solr.RptWithGeometrySpatialField" spatialContextFactory="JTS" geo="true" format="GeoJSON" autoIndex="true" validationRule="repairBuffer0" distErrPct="0.15" maxDistErr="0.001" distanceUnits="kilometers"/>
```

Then, add a dynamic field that maps to the newly defined field type.
``` xml
<dynamicField name="*_grpt" type="geojson_rpt" indexed="true" stored="true" allowMultiOverlap="true"/>
<dynamicField name="*_grptgeom" type="geojson_rptgeom" indexed="true" stored="true" allowMultiOverlap="true"/>
```
Once you have done this, you can store GeoJson data on these fields and run Spatial searches against them. The best way to test if it works is by storing a value. If it's invalid, Solr will throw and error than can be seen in the lgos.

e.g. The following filter query will return documents that intersect the given coordinate.
```
polygon_grpt:"Intersects(19.0497665 47.4916717)"
```

__Notes:__
- distErrPct and maxDistErr can be tweaked for less accuracy and faster performance.
- Solr recommends to not store these field types as it would be redundant and will increase index size.
> When using this field type, you will likely not want to mark the field as stored because itâ€™s redundant with the DocValues data and surely larger because of the formatting (be it WKT or GeoJSON). [Source](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/spatial-search.html#SpatialSearch-RptWithGeometrySpatialField)
- On the same link, Solr mentions an in-memory cache that can be enabled to improve performance.
> An optional in-memory cache can be defined in solrconfig.xml, which should be done when the data tends to have shapes with many vertices.
